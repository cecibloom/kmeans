Usage: ./kmeans [switches]
       -i filename      :   file containing data to be clustered (PATH)
       -c               :   configuration file (txt) (PATH)
       -t threshold     :   threshold value (NUMBER)

It is mandatory to set the configuration file as it contains all the setting that will be run and compare. 
Follow this format:

#	K	Thr	Loops
1	28	450	130	
2	25	400	120
3	19	350	88

Add as many setting as you want.

FORMAT:

First column:   Id, is not considered but we recommend to write a meaningful number. Mandatory
Second column:  K, number of cluster to be considered for the current setting. Mandatory
Third column:   Threshold, threshold agains wich the algorithm runs. Mandatory
Fourth column:  Loops, number of loops the algorithm will run. Mandatory.

IMPORTANT:  At least 2 settings mus be specified.
            The first valid setting will always be considered as the GOLDEN
